=========

This is a plugin for minecraft bukkit server. This will allow structured PvP and keep native gameplay of minecraft.

Current  features :

	* Complete 'admin-side' team management (assign a player to a team, kick a player from one team)

	* Persistent data (Using Serialization)
		
TODO list :
	
	1. Configuration file setup.
	
	2. Use a CommandExecutor class instead of Overriding the onCommand function.
	
	3. Use an event Handler instead of putting all events in the main class.
